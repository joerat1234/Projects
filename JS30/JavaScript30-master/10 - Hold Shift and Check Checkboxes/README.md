<h3>Selecting input using querySelector</h3>
In this example, all of the input boxes have a type of "checkbox" but no class to select them. A way to use querySelector to grab them is: <br>

`const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.inbox input[type = "checkbox"]')`
This will only work with the [] right after the word input.

More to come when brain isn't mush...
